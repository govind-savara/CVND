## Projects

### Facial Keypoint Detection
>[P1_Facial_Keypoints](https://github.com/govind-savara/CVND/tree/master/P1_Facial_Keypoints)

Applying knowledge of image processing and deep learning to create a CNN for facial keypoints (eyes, mouth, nose, etc.,) detection.

### Image Captioning
>[P2_Image_Captioning](https://github.com/govind-savara/CVND/tree/master/P2_Image_Captioning)

Using Neural Network architecture (a CNN-RNN model) to automatically generate captions from images. The main task is to implement an effective RNN decoder for a CNN encoder.
